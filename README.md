Here's a comprehensive and **step-by-step markdown guide** to deploy your Node.js app to a VPS server, based on our troubleshooting journey:

---

# **Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy Your Node.js App to a VPS**

This guide explains how to deploy your Node.js app to a VPS (Hostinger in this case) and ensure it is accessible via your server's public IP. It also includes the troubleshooting steps we resolved together to make the deployment work.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Host a Node.js App**:
   - Make sure your Node.js app (e.g., `subscription-tracker-api`) is ready with `app.js` or `server.js` as the entry point.
   - Ensure it has the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

2. **VPS Access**:
   - Access to a VPS server (Hostinger in this case).
   - SSH credentials for your VPS.

3. **Tools Installed Locally**:
   - `ssh` to connect to the VPS.
   - `git` to clone the repository or transfer files.

---

## **Step 1: Connect to Your VPS**

1. Log into your VPS via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<your-vps-ip>
   ```
   Replace `<your-vps-ip>` with the IP address of your VPS (e.g., `147.93.94.120`).

2. Once logged in, update your VPS packages:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

---

## **Step 2: Install Required Software**

1. Install Node.js (LTS version):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
   apt install -y nodejs
   ```

2. Verify Node.js and npm installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

3. Install PM2 to manage your Node.js app:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

4. Install Nginx to act as a reverse proxy:
   ```bash
   apt install nginx -y
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Transfer Your App to the VPS**

### **Option 1: Clone the Repository Using Git**
1. Install `git` on your VPS:
   ```bash
   apt install git -y
   ```

2. Clone your repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

### **Option 2: Transfer Files Directly**
If you’re not using Git:
1. Use `scp` to transfer files from your local machine to the VPS:
   ```bash
   scp -r /path/to/your/project root@<your-vps-ip>:/var/www/<your-project>
   ```

2. SSH into your VPS and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/<your-project>
   ```

---

## **Step 4: Set Up the App**

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
   Example `.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=5500
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id
   QSTASH_TOKEN=your_qstash_token
   ```

3. Start the app using PM2:
   ```bash
   pm2 start app.js --name subscription-tracker
   ```

4. Save the PM2 process list to restart on reboot:
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Configure Nginx**

### **Create a New Nginx Configuration**

1. Create a new Nginx configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/subscription-tracker
   ```

2. Add the following content:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;

       server_name <your-ipv4-address>; # Replace with your VPS IPv4 address

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5500; # Replace with your app's port
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`).

### **Enable the Configuration**
1. Create a symlink to enable the configuration:
   ```bash
   ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/subscription-tracker /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

2. Test the Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
   nginx -t
   ```

3. Restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```

---

## **Step 6: Open Firewall Ports**

Ensure that traffic on port `80` (HTTP) is allowed:
```bash
ufw allow 80
ufw enable
```

---

## **Step 7: Test Your App**

1. Visit your app in the browser using the public IPv4 address:
   ```
   http://<your-ipv4-address>
   ```

2. If you see:
   ```json
   {"error":{"message":"Not Found","status":404}}
   ```
   This means your app is running but doesn’t serve anything at the root (`/`). You can add routes to your app as needed.

---

## **Step 8: Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Nginx Welcome Page Shows**
- This happens when the default Nginx configuration is still active. Disable it:
  ```bash
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

### **Issue: Port 5500 Not Responding**
- Ensure the app is running and accessible locally:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5500
  ```

### **Issue: Permission Denied**
- Use `sudo` to execute commands requiring elevated privileges.

---

## **Optional: Add a Domain**
1. Point your domain’s DNS to your VPS IP (add an A record).
2. Update `server_name` in your Nginx config with your domain name:
   ```nginx
   server_name yourdomain.com;
   ```
3. Restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```

---

With these steps, you should have your Node.js app successfully deployed and accessible on your VPS. Let me know if you need further clarification!

To update the code on your VPS, you need to pull the latest changes from your repository (if you're using Git) or re-upload the updated files. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. If You’re Using Git**

#### **Step 1.1: Check Current Code State**
1. SSH into your VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<your-vps-ip>
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

#### **Step 1.2: Pull the Latest Changes**
1. Ensure the correct branch is checked out:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   If not, switch to the appropriate branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch-name>
   ```

---

### **2. If You’re Not Using Git**

#### **Option 1: Upload Files via SCP**
1. From your local machine, upload the updated files to the VPS:
   ```bash
   scp -r /local/path/to/project root@<your-vps-ip>:/path/to/project
   ```
   Replace `/local/path/to/project` with your local project path and `/path/to/project` with the directory on your VPS.

#### **Option 2: Use File Managers (Optional)**
- You can use tools like **FileZilla** or **WinSCP** to upload updated files to the VPS.

---

### **3. Install Dependencies (if Updated)**

If you’ve added or updated any dependencies in `package.json`, run the following commands in your project directory:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. If you’ve removed unused dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm prune
   ```

---

### **4. Restart the Application**

After updating the code, you need to restart your app to apply the changes. Use PM2 (or any other process manager you’re using):

1. Restart the app:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart subscription-tracker
   ```

2. If PM2 isn’t running the app, start it:
   ```bash
   pm2 start app.js --name subscription-tracker
   ```

3. Save the process to restart automatically on reboot:
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

---

### **5. Verify the Changes**

#### **Step 5.1: Test Locally on the VPS**
1. Test if the app is running locally:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5500
   ```
   - Replace `5500` with the port your app is running on.

#### **Step 5.2: Test Publicly**
1. Open your app’s public URL in the browser:
   ```bash
   http://<your-vps-ip>
   ```

---

### **6. Debug If Needed**
1. Check PM2 logs for errors:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs subscription-tracker
   ```

2. Check Nginx logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

3. Test API endpoints using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://<your-vps-ip>/api/workflow \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id"}'
   ```

---

### **Summary**

1. Use `git pull` or re-upload files to update your code.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` if necessary.
3. Restart your app with PM2: `pm2 restart subscription-tracker`.
4. Test locally and publicly to ensure the update is applied.
